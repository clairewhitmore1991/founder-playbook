# Founder Playbook

> A practical operating system for SaaS founders, solo builders, and bootstrappers.
> **No hype. No motivational fluff.** Just clear frameworks, templates, and checklists you can actually use while building.

This repo exists because most startup advice fails at the moment you try to execute it. If you're pre-revenue to early-scale and trying to move fast without breaking yourself or your company, this is for you.

## Who This Is For
* **SaaS founders** (B2B or B2C)
* **Solo founders** juggling product, growth, and ops
* **Bootstrappers** who need leverage, not burn

## What This Repo Is (and Is Not)
| This is: | This is NOT: |
| :--- | :--- |
| Copy-pasteable templates | Startup porn |
| Decision frameworks | Generic "believe in yourself" content |
| Checklists for high-leverage moments | VC-only advice assuming infinite runway |

## How to Use This Repo
1. Start with `0-start-here`.
2. Pull only what you need for your current stage.
3. Adapt templates into your own tools (Notion, Docs, Linear, etc.).
4. **Treat it like a toolbox, not a book.** You are not meant to read this end-to-end.
